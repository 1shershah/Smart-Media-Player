# Search-by-Voice Project for the Intel Edge AI Scholarship Challenge 2020 SpeechVINO study group

## Goal:
To develop a search-by-voice application at the edge to detect time period(s) during audio/video play where specific persons are speaking with Intel's OpenVINO Toolkit

## Plan of Attack:
TODO
